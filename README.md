# PalisadeOS-b01202026-Jan20-2026
PalisadeOS b01202026 introduces a unified real-hardware boot architecture spanning Android devices, UEFI systems, and legacy BIOS PCs. This build establishes strict boot contracts, safe firmware consumption, deterministic program runtimes, and cross-arch kernel semantics, prioritizing recoverability, inspection, and low-level correctness.
